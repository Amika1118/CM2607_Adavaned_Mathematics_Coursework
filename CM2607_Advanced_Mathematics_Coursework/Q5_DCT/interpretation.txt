Image transforms show low frequencies for the background and high frequencies for details like license plate edges.
Fourier transforms remove noise, and DCT helps compress images for OCR (text recognition).
These methods make vehicle recognition systems work well in different conditions (light, weather, etc.).
Using these tools, we can track vehicles, predict traffic delays, and change routes in real time to improve traffic flow.
