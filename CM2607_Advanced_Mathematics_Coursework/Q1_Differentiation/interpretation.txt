The bus travel time gradient (2ax, 2by) means travel time increases quickly with both distance and traffic delay, especially affecting buses with many stops on Maradana Road.
The taxi travel time gradient (√c x/√(x²+y²), √c y/√(x²+y²)) shows a more balanced effect from distance and delay, making taxis better for direct routes like Darley Road.
Because of this, taxis are less affected by traffic delays, so they are a good choice when there is congestion.
Knowing this can help people choose the right transport mode and help planners make Colombo's transport network work better.
