FFT analysis of passenger data shows strong low-frequency peaks (0.05–0.2 cycles/hour) matching morning and evening rush hours.
Buses have stronger low-frequency peaks because they carry more people at regular times.
By putting more buses on the road during these peak times, we can reduce overcrowding and waiting.
This helps make Colombo's transport system more reliable and less congested.
